**Finally the day i stop procrastinating**

After almost 6 month of having the intent to make and launch this website, I finally wake my ass up and finished this website in 1 week times.
I know 1 week only for this website is too much of a time but *IN MY DEFENSE* i have many things to do including my flutter project for my bootcamp.

Well, initially i kinda don't know what content i should provide ini this website but after taking inspiration from other portofolio website i decided
to put my rant about tech and other into blog and make some documetation about programming. At first i wanna use gatsbyJS for both my website and blog
but after getting inpateient i decided to use [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) for my Blog's SSG (Static Site Generator) of chice and keep using [gatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for
my main portofolio website

# What's next

Well after finishing this website now i'm gonna rest for lil'bit and after that i'm gonna try to make the mobile design for my website, because i haven't made
this website responsive yet. Maybe in near future i'm gonna document the process of making this website on this blog.

Either way, please keep reading my blog. There will be more interesting content in this blog including about technology, anime, and others. 

See you next time

たか out....
